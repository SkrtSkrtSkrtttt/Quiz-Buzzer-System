# Quiz-Buzzer-System
In quiz shows, especially entertainment activities (e.g. competitive answering activities), organizers
often apply a buzzer system in order to accurately, fairly and visually determine the seat number of a
responder.
Now the system can illustrate the accuracy and equity of the judgment by data, which improves the
entertainment. At the same time, it is more fair and just. In this project, we will use some buttons,
buzzers, and LEDs to make a quiz buzzer system.

Experimental Principle
Button 1, 2 and 3 are answer buttons, and button 4 is the reset button. If button 1 is pressed first, the
buzzer will beep, the corresponding LED will light up and all the other LEDs will go out. If you want to
start another round, press button 4 to reset.
